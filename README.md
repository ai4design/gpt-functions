# Legal Advice Chatbot

This Python script integrates the GPT-3.5-turbo-0613 model from OpenAI to assist users in seeking legal advice on specific topics, in this instance, related to employment laws.

## Features:

- **Function Calling with OpenAI**: Uses the function calling feature of OpenAI to simulate a call to a hypothetical function to retrieve legal information.
  
- **Conversational Interface with Langchain**: Utilizes the `ChatOpenAI` class from `langchain` to make the interaction more conversational.

## Prerequisites:

1. **Python**: This script is written in Python, and you should have Python installed to run it.

2. **OpenAI**: You should have an OpenAI account and access to the GPT-3.5-turbo-0613 model. Set your API key in an `.env` file with the variable name `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

3. **Dependencies**: Install the required libraries using:
    ```bash
    pip install openai langchain python-dotenv
    ```

4. **Environment Variables**: Use the `dotenv` library to load environment variables. Ensure you have a `.env` file with the necessary API keys.

## Usage:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd [repository_directory]
    ```

3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```

## Warning:

The script uses `eval` to dynamically call a function. This can be potentially unsafe if the data source isn't trusted. Always ensure to sanitize and validate data before executing.
